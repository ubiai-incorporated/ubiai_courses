# The New AI Stack: Evaluation → Deployment → Feedback → Tuning → Iteration

## Introduction

The lifecycle of modern AI systems has shattered the old "train-deploy-forget" paradigm. What emerged is a continuous loop where models live in perpetual beta—always learning, always adapting. This new AI stack isn't a linear pipeline but a flywheel where each component fuels the next: rigorous evaluation informs safer deployment, deployment generates feedback, feedback guides tuning, and tuning enables better iterations. 

Unlike traditional software stacks with clear layers of abstraction, this cycle operates at all levels simultaneously. A single bad output detected in deployment might trigger immediate tuning, which then requires reevaluation before the next iteration. The stack isn't just about technology—it's about building organizational muscle memory for continuous adaptation.

## Evaluation: The Gatekeeper of Quality

Evaluation has evolved from a one-time checkpoint to an always-on radar system. In the new stack, you're not just evaluating model accuracy, but its readiness for the real world's messy unpredictability.

**Key Dimensions:**
- **Capability Testing**: Can it handle edge cases? (e.g., medical queries with missing symptoms)
- **Safety Testing**: Does it resist jailbreaks? Are refusal behaviors appropriate?
- **Stochastic Testing**: How does performance vary across 100+ runs of the same prompt?
- **Shadow Testing**: Run new models alongside production without affecting users

The most advanced teams now use "evaluation chains"—multi-step tests where one evaluation triggers another. For example, if a model fails a factual accuracy test on recent events, it automatically gets tested for related knowledge gaps. This creates evaluation networks that adapt to the model's weaknesses.

## Deployment: Gradual Exposure as a Safety Net

Gone are the days of big-bang model launches. Modern deployment is a controlled exposure therapy—slowly introducing the model to real-world complexity while keeping emergency brakes within reach.

**Progressive Deployment Tactics:**
- **Canary Releases**: 1% of traffic sees the new model, with automatic rollback on anomaly detection
- **Geofencing**: Limit initial deployment to regions where errors are least critical
- **Context-Aware Routing**: Send only certain query types to new models (e.g., non-medical)
- **Human Firebreaks**: Critical domains (legal/financial) always route through human review first

The best deployment strategies treat models like junior employees—they start with supervised, low-stakes tasks and earn more responsibility as they prove reliability. This phased approach turns deployment into a diagnostic tool, revealing failure modes that evaded evaluation.

## Feedback: The Lifeblood of Improvement

In the new stack, feedback collection isn't passive—it's an active interrogation of the model's behavior. Every user interaction becomes a potential data point, but harvesting signal from noise requires careful engineering.

**Feedback Architecture Components:**
- **Implicit Signals**: Track where users edit model outputs or abandon conversations
- **Explicit Signals**: Structured rating systems with severity tiers (e.g., "minor error" vs "dangerous hallucination")
- **Context Capture**: Store the full interaction chain—not just the faulty output
- **Bias Guards**: Actively solicit feedback from underrepresented user groups

Advanced systems now use "feedback triangulation"—correlating user ratings with embedding shifts and external knowledge updates. When all three align, it signals a high-priority tuning opportunity.

## Tuning: Surgical Precision Over Blunt Retraining

The tuning phase has graduated from sledgehammers to scalpels. Instead of full retraining, modern approaches target specific weaknesses while preserving core capabilities.

**Modern Tuning Toolkit:**
- **Delta Tuning**: Only update small adapter layers instead of all parameters
- **Contrastive Tuning**: Strengthen correct behaviors by showing paired good/bad outputs
- **Memory-Augmented Updates**: Inject new knowledge via vector databases without weight changes
- **Ethical Fine-Tuning**: Use constitutional AI principles to align model boundaries

The most effective tuning follows the 80/20 rule—20% of targeted changes should address 80% of observed issues. This requires ruthless prioritization based on impact and frequency metrics from the feedback phase.

## Iteration: Closing the Loop Without Starting Over

Iteration in the new stack isn't cyclical—it's helical. Each loop should elevate the system to higher performance plateaus while maintaining stability.

**Iteration Best Practices:**
- **Versioned Experimentation**: Maintain parallel model variants for A/B testing
- **Rolling Baselines**: Compare against both the previous version and absolute benchmarks
- **Change Impact Forecasting**: Predict how tuning might affect unrelated capabilities
- **Technical Debt Tracking**: Log shortcuts that will need future refactoring

Top teams now use "iteration sprints"—2-4 week cycles focusing on one improvement dimension (e.g., safety, accuracy, latency). This balances velocity with stability better than either continuous tweaking or quarterly mega-updates.

## The Stack as a Competitive Advantage

This new AI stack doesn't just prevent degradation—it creates compounding advantages. Teams that master the evaluation-deployment-feedback-tuning-iteration cycle see their models improve exponentially while others struggle with stagnation. 

The stack's real power emerges when all components feed each other autonomously: deployment anomalies trigger evaluation refinements, feedback patterns suggest new tuning approaches, and iteration learnings upgrade the entire system's architecture. In this paradigm, the model isn't the product—the improvement engine is.
