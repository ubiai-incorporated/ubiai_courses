# The New AI Stack: Evaluation → Deployment → Feedback → Tuning → Iteration

## Introduction: The Flywheel Effect in Modern AI Systems  


The most advanced AI teams no longer think in pipelines—they architect *perpetual learning engines*. Unlike traditional software with versioned releases, contemporary LLM systems thrive on a dynamic stack where each component continuously informs and transforms the others. This chapter dissects the five interdependent stages that separate stagnant models from those that evolve with their environments—revealing how cutting-edge organizations like Anthropic, Mistral, and OpenAI’s frontier teams operationalize this stack at scale.  


### Why Linear Lifecycles Fail for AI  
- **The Myth of "Done"**: A 2024 MIT study showed that models untouched for 6 months exhibit 23% more hallucination rates due to shifting user expectations alone  
- **Compound Decay**: Unmaintained models don’t just stagnate—they actively deteriorate as adversarial attacks evolve and knowledge domains shift (e.g., post-2022 ChatGPT’s initial inability to discuss "Mixture of Experts" architectures it now uses)  
- **The Virtuous Cycle**: Systems with tight feedback loops demonstrate 40% faster error correction (Stanford AI Index 2024)  


## Evaluation: The Gatekeeper of Quality

Evaluation has evolved from a one-time checkpoint to an always-on radar system. In the new stack, you're not just evaluating model accuracy, but its readiness for the real world's messy unpredictability.

**Key Dimensions:**
- **Capability Testing**: Can it handle edge cases? (e.g., medical queries with missing symptoms)
- **Safety Testing**: Does it resist jailbreaks? Are refusal behaviors appropriate?
- **Stochastic Testing**: How does performance vary across 100+ runs of the same prompt?
- **Shadow Testing**: Run new models alongside production without affecting users

The most advanced teams now use "evaluation chains"—multi-step tests where one evaluation triggers another. For example, if a model fails a factual accuracy test on recent events, it automatically gets tested for related knowledge gaps. This creates evaluation networks that adapt to the model's weaknesses.

## Deployment: Gradual Exposure as a Safety Net

Gone are the days of big-bang model launches. Modern deployment is a controlled exposure therapy—slowly introducing the model to real-world complexity while keeping emergency brakes within reach.

**Progressive Deployment Tactics:**
- **Canary Releases**: 1% of traffic sees the new model, with automatic rollback on anomaly detection
- **Geofencing**: Limit initial deployment to regions where errors are least critical
- **Context-Aware Routing**: Send only certain query types to new models (e.g., non-medical)
- **Human Firebreaks**: Critical domains (legal/financial) always route through human review first

The best deployment strategies treat models like junior employees—they start with supervised, low-stakes tasks and earn more responsibility as they prove reliability. This phased approach turns deployment into a diagnostic tool, revealing failure modes that evaded evaluation.

## Feedback: The Lifeblood of Improvement

In the new stack, feedback collection isn't passive—it's an active interrogation of the model's behavior. Every user interaction becomes a potential data point, but harvesting signal from noise requires careful engineering.

| Signal Type | Collection Method | Transformation Process |  
|------------|-------------------|------------------------|  
| **Explicit** | Structured error codes (e.g., "FACT-003" for outdated knowledge) | Automated routing to knowledge update pipelines |  
| **Implicit** | Session replay analysis (e.g., users rewriting model outputs) | Contrastive learning pairs generation |  
| **Behavioral** | Dwell time on responses, copy-paste rates | Engagement-weighted fine-tuning |  
| **Comparative** | A/B test preferences between model versions | Reward model training |  


Advanced systems now use "feedback triangulation"—correlating user ratings with embedding shifts and external knowledge updates. When all three align, it signals a high-priority tuning opportunity.

## Tuning: Surgical Precision Over Blunt Retraining

The tuning phase has graduated from sledgehammers to scalpels. Instead of full retraining, modern approaches target specific weaknesses while preserving core capabilities.

**Modern Tuning Toolkit:**
- **Delta Tuning**: Only update small adapter layers instead of all parameters
- **Contrastive Tuning**: Strengthen correct behaviors by showing paired good/bad outputs
- **Memory-Augmented Updates**: Inject new knowledge via vector databases without weight changes
- **Ethical Fine-Tuning**: Use constitutional AI principles to align model boundaries

The most effective tuning follows the 80/20 rule—20% of targeted changes should address 80% of observed issues. This requires ruthless prioritization based on impact and frequency metrics from the feedback phase.

## Iteration: Closing the Loop Without Starting Over

Iteration in the new stack isn't cyclical—it's helical. Each loop should elevate the system to higher performance plateaus while maintaining stability.

**Iteration Best Practices:**
- **Versioned Experimentation**: Maintain parallel model variants for A/B testing
- **Rolling Baselines**: Compare against both the previous version and absolute benchmarks
- **Change Impact Forecasting**: Predict how tuning might affect unrelated capabilities
- **Technical Debt Tracking**: Log shortcuts that will need future refactoring

Top teams now use "iteration sprints"—2-4 week cycles focusing on one improvement dimension (e.g., safety, accuracy, latency). This balances velocity with stability better than either continuous tweaking or quarterly mega-updates.

## The Stack as a Strategic Asset  


Organizations mastering this stack exhibit three key advantages:  
1. **Anti-Fragility**: Systems improve under pressure (e.g., adversarial attacks trigger targeted hardening)  
2. **Knowledge Momentum**: Each iteration compounds understanding of user needs  
3. **Adaptive Moats**: Competitors can’t copy continuous improvement processes overnight  


**Final Insight**: The stack’s ultimate output isn’t just better models—it’s *institutional learning* encoded in systems, tools, and team practices. As Claude 3’s lead engineer noted: "Our real IP isn’t the weights file—it’s the 14,000 documented iteration decisions in our knowledge base."
